# Employee Details
This code allows the user to register new employee details to the database or login to the portal using jsp,servlets and JDBC. The login details are authenticated and a new session gets created. The user can then view details of all the employees in the database. 
The webpages are secured using session so that any user cant view employee details without logging in.
